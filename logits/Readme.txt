DATA:

c10 = CIFAR-10
c100 = CIFAR-100
imgnet = ImageNet
cars = Stanford Cars (http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)
birds = Birds dataset (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html)
SVHN = Google Street View House Numbers

MODELS:

Resnet110 - ResNet with 110 layers
densenet40 - DenseNet 40
resnet_wide32 - Wide ResNet 32
lenet - LeNet 5

Outputs:

logits - instead of probabilities, there are just network outputs without softmaxing. Use softmax function to get actual probabilities.
